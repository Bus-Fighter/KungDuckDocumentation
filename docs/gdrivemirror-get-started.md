### 2. Configure Mirror Settings

In the settings window:

- **Service Account Credential JSON Path**  
  Enter the full path to your Google service account key file.  
  You can also click the gear button to browse manually.

- **Refresh On Enter Play Mode**  
  Tick this if you want Unity to auto-refresh files each time you hit play.

- **Invoke Refresh**  
  Press this button to manually sync all items from Google Drive.

### 3. Add Mirror Items

Each item represents one file to sync:

![Mirror Item Settings](../images/image3.png)

- **Asset Folder Path**: Local folder in `Assets/Info/` to store the data.
- **Google Drive ID**: The file ID found in the Google Drive share URL.
- **Optional Local Asset Name**: Optional custom filename (without extension).  
  If left blank, it uses the original file name from Drive.

## üí° Tips

- Drive file URL:  
  `https://drive.google.com/file/d/**YOUR_FILE_ID**/view`

- Files are pulled in as raw bytes (usually `.xlsx` or `.csv`) and can be loaded using your own import logic.
